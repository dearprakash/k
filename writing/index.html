    <h1>Easy Deploying with Middleman and GitHub Pages</h1>

<p><time>May 7th, 2015</time></p>

<p>I wanted easy way to deploy Middleman&rsquo;s static files to GitHub Pages â€“ all while keeping the source available, without having to manage multiple repositories.</p>

<p>Create a <code>dev</code> branch in your repository, this is where your <code>source</code> files will be housed and will be your working/development branch.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ git checkout -b dev
</code></pre>

<p>Update your <code>Gemfile</code> to include:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'middleman-deploy'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'~&gt; 1.0'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Then run <code>$ bundle install</code> to see to it that the gem is installed.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve successfully installed the <code>middleman-deploy</code> gem, activate deploying in your <code>config.rb</code> file:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">activate</span> <span class="ss">:deploy</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">deploy</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">deploy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">build_before</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kp">true</span> <span class="c1"># runs build before deploying</span>
  <span class="n">deploy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">method</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">:git</span>
  <span class="n">deploy</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">branch</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'master'</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Running <code>middleman deploy</code> will build and push your build to the <code>master</code> branch of your repository, where it will then be live for production.</p>

    <h1>Guest Post on Divshot</h1>

<p><time>March 10, 2015</time></p>

<p>I was given the opportunity to help write a guest post for <a href="http://seesparkbox.com">Sparkbox</a> on <a href="http://divshot.io">Divshot&rsquo;s</a> blog.</p>

<p>I wrote about our experience teaching the Girl Scouts of Western Ohio how to build and deploy their own websites. We wanted to be sure that deployment was easy and didn&rsquo;t require CLI or FTP. We taught the girls how to ZIP up their websites and upload them to the web. Divshot made this extremely easy and asked us to share our experience.</p>

<p>Check out our post <a href="https://divshot.com/blog/guest/girl-scouts-workshop/">Girl Scouts Workshop with GSWO + Sparkbox</a> to learn more.</p>

    <h1>My First Week as a Sparkbox Apprentice</h1>

<p>My first week as an apprentice at <a href="http://seesparkbox.com">Sparkbox</a> is in the bag and I already feel that I am learning at a much quicker pace than I was on my own. I&rsquo;ve been working with Git regularly, began customizing my shell, gained a few pingpong skills and had my fair share of amazing food. I am excited for what the future holds.</p>

<h2>Dotfiles</h2>

<p>Bouncing around from meetup to meetup in Chicago, I had always heard about dotfiles, but didn&rsquo;t fully understand how they were used and how important they actually are. On Thursday, <a href="https://github.com/asimpson">Adam</a> gave us a talk on how to begin customizing your shell and told us about the benefits of creating and storing your dotfiles.</p>

<p>Dotfiles are used to store application settings and preferences, aliases for commands and a lot of other cool things. I have only scratched the surface with a few aliases for now, but I am spending a good bit of time furthering my knowledge about customizing my shell. My dotfiles can be found here.</p>

<h2>Pingpong</h2>

<p>When I say pingpong is a big deal at Sparkbox, pingpong is a big deal at Sparkbox. Most games are played in two teams of 2 and get quite intense. I&rsquo;ve played a few games of ping-volley-ball-pong, but I&rsquo;m in need of a bit more practice before I will be up for a serious match.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/drewclemens">Drew</a> helped with my serve, which in turn helped with my over all playing capabilities. I can get extremely competitive when it comes to any type of game, so I&rsquo;m sure volleypong will be no different.</p>

<h2>The Ever So Glorious Food</h2>

<p>I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Friday lunches are served up family style and the food is amazing. How can you top grilled chicken and steak, a baked potato bar, asparagus, salad and sweets? The catch is that we&rsquo;ll have to top it from here on out (we&rsquo;ll be assisting with Friday lunches).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/danrosenthal">Dan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kaseybon">Kasey</a> and I have created a calendar where we&rsquo;ve scheduled out our dessert and meal plan rotation, although we all plan to share Friday&rsquo;s duties of cooking and cleaning. I look forward to seeing what meal ideas brew from it and showing off my kitchen skills.</p>

<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great feeling to wake up in the morning and feel excitement for what lies ahead. Everyday before I walk into the Sparkbox office I get this feeling. I am both nervous and determined. This journey isn&rsquo;t for the faint of heart and I am gaining confidence the more I learn.</p>
