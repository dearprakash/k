# Colophon
This website was produced over the course of two weeks during my time as an apprentice at Sparkbox.

## Design
When it came to design decisions, I took a rapid-prototyping approach. CodePen is where majority of my protyping took place â€“ where I was able to iterate quickly to get the ball rolling.

### Typography
This website uses two primary typefaces, Proxima Nova, served by TypeKit alongside Monospace for `<code>` and `<pre>` things. Fallback fonts for Proxima Nova include Helvetica and system default sans-serif.

### Scalable Vector Graphics
The home button for this site is an SVG and was designed in Adobe Illustrator then refined and animated on CodePen.

## Development

### Hosting
Hosting is generously provided by GitHub. I chose to use GitHub Pages because it is free, reliable, and suits my current needs.

### Middleman
Using Middleman, for me, was a no-brainer. Middleman is a Ruby on Rails framework that builds static sites, which can be hosted almost anywhere. It is flexible, customizable and down right easy to use.

### Version Control
Version control is managed though `$ git` and stored in a repository on GitHub.

### Analytics
