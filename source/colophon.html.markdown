# Colophon
This website was produced over the course of a few weeks during my time as an apprentice at [Sparkbox](http://seesparkbox.com).

## Design
When it came to design decisions, I took a rapid-prototyping approach. [CodePen](http://codepen.io) is where majority of my protyping took place â€“ where I was able to iterate quickly to get the ball rolling.

### Typography
This website uses two primary typefaces, Proxima Nova, served by [TypeKit](http://typekit.com) alongside Monospace for `<code>` and `<pre>` things. Fallback fonts for Proxima Nova include Helvetica and system default sans-serif.

### Scalable Vector Graphics
The home button for this site is an SVG and was designed in Adobe Illustrator then refined and [animated on CodePen](http://codepen.io/laurendorman/pen/VLeyxq).

## Development

### Hosting
Hosting is generously provided by GitHub. I chose to use [GitHub Pages](http://github.com/pages) because it is free, reliable, and suits my current needs.

### Middleman
Using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), for me, was a no-brainer. Middleman is a static site generator built on top of Rails, which can be hosted almost anywhere. It is flexible, customizable and down right easy to use.

### Version Control
Version control is managed though `$ git` and stored in a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/laurendorman/laurendorman.github.io).

### Universal SSL
I am using a free SSL in order to improve my visibility on the web. SSL for this site is provided by [CloudFlare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/).

### Analytics
This site uses [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/), servered by [CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com).
