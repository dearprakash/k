# Tech Podcasts Featuring Diverse Voices
<time>December 7th, 2015</time>

A few months back, I began building my podcast library in search of tech
podcasts to listen to during my commute to and from work as a way to
stay up to date with what’s taking place in the industry. I quickly
began to realize that many of the podcasts that I was recommended failed
to feature diverse voices and only offer limited views. I decided to
share the podcasts that I found on my journey that open their doors to
underrepresented groups.

## Revision Path

Revision Path shares the stories of people of color working in tech from
founders to developers who are just getting their start in the industry.
In Episode 50, host [Maurice Cherry] speaks with [Angelica Ross],
founder of TransTech, covering the web as a safe place to work,
utilizing the web to learn and the challenges of finding funding as an
LGBTQ member and person of color.

## CodeNewbies

CodeNewbies is known for its forum, weekly Twitter chat and knowledge
sharing efforts. Their podcast, hosted by founder [Saron Yitbarek],
introduces programming enthusiasts to industry leaders and newbies
alike, telling the story of their coding journeys. In Episode 48,
[Nicole Dominguez] of Sawhorse Media discusses learning to code with
Neopets pages, her journey from freelance to full-time as a self-taught
designer and front-end developer, why she decided to leave college and
*working with people who look like you*.

## Tomorrow

Tomorrow is a podcast hosted by [Joshua Topolsky] who talks the web and
tech with diverse voices in the industry. In Episode 25, Joshua speaks
with [Anil Dash] about why Makerbase exists, Indian representation in
tech, ways to improve collecting gender data and AdBlockers.

## Two Black Nerds

Two Black Nerds is a podcast hosted by software engineer [Iheanyi
Ekechukwu] and mechanical engineer [Romeo Kwihangana], two Notre Dame
graduates who discuss their day to day lives after graduation. In this
episode, they take on how to navigate issues at work as a Black person
with recent police brutality incidents and mass shootings.

## Slack Variety Pack

Slack is a company that is known for their intent to create a diverse
team. From their culture team, the [Earthtones], to their marketing
efforts – Slack is an active advocate for diversity and inclusion in
tech. Although Variety Pack is a slightly newer podcast, my guess is
that their podcast efforts will be no different. In Episode 5, Slack
covers the origin of the elevator pitch, talks smart watches and speaks
with founders [Kaya Thomas] of We Read Too and [Kimberly Bryant] of
Black Girls Code.
