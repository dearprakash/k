    </h1>
  
  <time datetime="2015-01-19T05:00:00.000Z">January 19th, 2015</time>
  <p>My first week as an apprentice at <a href="http://seesparkbox.com">Sparkbox</a> is in the bag and I already feel that I am learning at a much quicker pace than I was on my own. I’ve been working with Git regularly, began customizing my shell, gained a few pingpong skills and had my fair share of amazing food. I am excited for what the future holds.</p>
<h2 id="Dotfiles"><a href="#Dotfiles" class="headerlink" title="Dotfiles"></a>Dotfiles</h2><p>Bouncing around from meetup to meetup in Chicago, I had always heard about dotfiles, but didn’t fully understand how they were used and how important they actually are. On Thursday, <a href="https://github.com/asimpson">Adam</a> gave us a talk on how to begin customizing your shell and told us about the benefits of creating and storing your dotfiles.</p>
<p>Dotfiles are used to store application settings and preferences, aliases for commands and a lot of other cool things. I have only scratched the surface with a few aliases for now, but I am spending a good bit of time furthering my knowledge about customizing my shell. My dotfiles can be found here.</p>
<h2 id="Pingpong"><a href="#Pingpong" class="headerlink" title="Pingpong"></a>Pingpong</h2><p>When I say pingpong is a big deal at Sparkbox, pingpong is a big deal at Sparkbox. Most games are played in two teams of 2 and get quite intense. I’ve played a few games of ping-volley-ball-pong, but I’m in need of a bit more practice before I will be up for a serious match.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/drewclemens">Drew</a> helped with my serve, which in turn helped with my over all playing capabilities. I can get extremely competitive when it comes to any type of game, so I’m sure volleypong will be no different.</p>
<h2 id="The-Ever-So-Glorious-Food"><a href="#The-Ever-So-Glorious-Food" class="headerlink" title="The Ever So Glorious Food"></a>The Ever So Glorious Food</h2><p>I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Friday lunches are served up family style and the food is amazing. How can you top grilled chicken and steak, a baked potato bar, asparagus, salad and sweets? The catch is that we’ll have to top it from here on out (we’ll be assisting with Friday lunches).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/danrosenthal">Dan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kaseybon">Kasey</a> and I have created a calendar where we’ve scheduled out our dessert and meal plan rotation, although we all plan to share Friday’s duties of cooking and cleaning. I look forward to seeing what meal ideas brew from it and showing off my kitchen skills.</p>
<h2 id="Closing-Remarks"><a href="#Closing-Remarks" class="headerlink" title="Closing Remarks"></a>Closing Remarks</h2><p>It’s a great feeling to wake up in the morning and feel excitement for what lies ahead. Everyday before I walk into the Sparkbox office I get this feeling. I am both nervous and determined. This journey isn’t for the faint of heart and I am gaining confidence the more I learn.</p>
<p>To keep up with my progress, read my <a href="https://github.com/laurendorman/sparkbox-apprenticeship-journal">apprenticeship journal</a>.</p>
